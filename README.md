# C-libs
This repository contains a helpful c++ classes like String class and List class.
it offers a wide range of used types in many diffrent projects, i hope you find it helpful.

- Note : i couldn't finish "List" class since my knowledge of dynamic memory allocation was just rushed and not based on any prev-experiences.

**I was stupid to think someone would ever see this repo and use it since I was only a too early-c++ developer**
